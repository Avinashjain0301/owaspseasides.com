Welcome to the Annual OWASP SeaSides InfoSec event. 

Through OWASP [Bangalore chapter](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bangalore) we aim to provide free of cost premium workshops and talks to all the participants. We plan to have Workshop on **27th and 28th Feb \(9AM to 6PM\)** and beach side talks on evening **7 to 10 pm**. Mega beach side party on 2nd march.

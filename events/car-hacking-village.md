# Reversing and Exploitation of Vehicle \(CAR Hacking\)

**Abstract**

Today all vehicles are connected through V2X technologies. All manufacturers are coming with new technologies which can be added technologies for Vehicle industries like Fleet management systems, diagnosis toolset etc. These systems are from third-party vendors which are still in the vulnerable state. So addressing their weaknesses requires specific skillset in cybersecurity of vehicle industries. In this course will provide real CAR  to get Hands On the experience of CAR and their component security testing. "Reversing and exploitation of Vehicle" course targeted from Basic level to advance level. During course will provide Virtual machine which has an all necessary toolkit which can be used after training for Vehicle security testing.

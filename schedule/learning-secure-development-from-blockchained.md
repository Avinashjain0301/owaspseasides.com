# Learning Secure Development from Blockchained

**Abstract :**

Lets Attack the Bltcoin's blockchian implementation and learn how worlds most valued financial network is also worlds most secure given the fact its completely open and autonomous.  
In this workshop we will do threat modeling of a Bitcoin's blockchain implementation and study its layer by layer design to thwart the listed threats.We enumerate and understand each single crypto constructs used in every layer and how it is secure now and also in the wake of Quantum Computing realization in near future.

**Overview:**  
1. Introduction to Blockchain.2. How a block looks like on the disc3. What crypto-constructs go in each block4. Threat Modeling of Blockchain.\* List down all applicable threat to blockchain with the help of the participants5. Learning defense in depth, built in the block design6. Scripts in Bitcoins7. Smart Contracts and security issues with a case study of Ethereum8. Where Bitcoins go wrong?9. Summing it up  
Take Aways :  
1. Understanding of the building blocks of cryptography used in Blockchain technology2. How to threat model a complex system3. How to deal with security threats in an un-trusted, distributed environment4. How to build a financial system securely.5. Smart contracts, dumb implementation6. Dos and Donts of cryptography considering the quantum threat7. Above all, understand What blockchain is and what it is Not.

**Who should attend :**  
Professionals from enterprise, banking and financial organisations, LEA and any one who wish to understand how Blockchain works and how they are secure by design.
